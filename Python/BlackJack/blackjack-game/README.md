## Game Rules
- The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without going over.
- Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11.
- Each player starts with two cards, and the dealer has one card face up and one face down.
- Players can choose to hit (take another card), stand (keep their current hand), double down (double their bet and take one more card), or split (if they have two cards of the same value, they can split them into two hands).
